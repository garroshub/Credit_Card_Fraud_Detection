# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

A machine learning model using classification algorithms and techniques to accurately detect if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. 

# What is Credit card fraud?

Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft that involves an unauthorized taking of anotherâ€™s credit card information for the purpose of charging purchases to the account or removing funds from it.

# Introduction

In this project, we will develop a machine learning model using classification algorithms and techniques to accurately detect if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. 

# Data Sourcing
 
 Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1
 
A synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim was used as the dataset for building the model used in this project. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.
